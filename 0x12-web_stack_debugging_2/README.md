# 0x12. Web stack debugging #2

## Background Context

For this project, we are expected to look at these concepts:

- [Network basics](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/33)
- [Docker](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/65)
- [Web stack debugging](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/68)

The Webstack debugging series will train you in the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.


## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- The Bash script must pass ```Shellcheck``` (version 0.3.7) without any error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- All Bash scripts must run without error
