# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

## Background Context

For this project, we are expected to look at these concepts:

- [DNS](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/12)
- [Web stack debugging](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/68)

### What happens when you don’t secure your website traffic?

When a website says not secure it can have serious consequences, especially if it is an eCommerce site. Insecure websites are vulnerable to cyberthreats, including malware and cyberattacks. If your site falls victim to a cyberattack, it can impact the site’s functioning, prevent visitors from accessing it, or compromise your customers’ personal information. In addition, a cyberattack can damage your company’s reputation and cost you customers. Research shows if your customers’ confidential information gets compromised, 65% of them won’t return to your site. Along with the loss of customers comes a loss of revenue, which can be especially devastating to small businesses.
