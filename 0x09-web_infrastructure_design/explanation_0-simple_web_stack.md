# Simple web stack

A one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com

## Specifics about this infrastructure:
### What is a server
- The server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure. and runs an OS (operating system), accessible only by a network. 
- The servers are often housed in dedicated data centers.
- It takes care of handling requests from visitors, running different parts of the website, and talking to the database.

### What is the role of the domain name
- The domain name "foobar.com" is a human-readable address that represents the server's IP address (8.8.8.8 in this case).
- A DNS (Domain Name System) server translates the domain name into the corresponding IP address, allowing users to access the server by its name.

### What type of DNS record:
- The www.foobar.com is an A record because it resolves to an IP address.
- www Is a subdomain, and the DNS record for "www" is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the main domain record.
- if the IP address changes we can only record changes in the DNS A record of foobar.com.
- The ("foobar.com") associates "www.foobar.com" with the same IP address (8.8.8.8).

### What is the role of the web server
- The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users.
- It serves static content (HTML, CSS,...) directly to users and routes dynamic requests to the application server.
- It acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the application server and returning responses to users.

### What is the role of the application server
- The application server processes dynamic content requests (generated by user interactions or database queries).
- It communicates with the web server to execute application logic, generate dynamic content, and return responses.

### What is the role of the database
- The database (MySQL) stores and manages structured data, such as user accounts, content, and configurations,.......
- The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update data based on user requests.

### What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
- The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with users computers.
- When a user enters the URL, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), which is then processed by the web and application servers.

## Issues with this Infrastructure:

### Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Having only one server is risky because all components are hosted on this single server, if this server fails, the whole website goes down.
### Downtime during Maintenance:
When we need to update things, like putting new stuff on the website, we might have to pause it for a bit. This can lead to temporary downtime for visitors.
### Limited Scalability:
If a lot of visitors come to the website at once, the server might struggle . This infrastructure cannot handle high amounts of incoming traffic effectively. It cannot scale horizontally to accommodate increased load.
