## Specifics about this infrastructure:
1. What is a server
- The server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts the entire web infrastructure. It takes care of handling requests from visitors, running different parts of the website, and talking to the database.

2. What is the role of the domain name
- The domain name "foobar.com" is a human-readable address that represents the server's IP address (8.8.8.8 in this case).
- A DNS (Domain Name System) server translates the domain name into the corresponding IP address, allowing users to access the server by its name.

3. What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
- Is a subdomain, and the DNS record for "www" is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record that points to the main domain record 
- The ("foobar.com") associates "www.foobar.com" with the same IP address (8.8.8.8).

4. What is the role of the web server
- The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users.
- It serves static content (HTML, CSS,...) directly to users and routes dynamic requests to the application server.
- It acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to the application server and returning responses to users.

5. What is the role of the application server
- The application server processes dynamic content requests (generated by user interactions or database queries).
- It communicates with the web server to execute application logic, generate dynamic content, and return responses.

6. What is the role of the database
- The database (MySQL) stores and manages structured data, such as user accounts, content, and configurations,.......
- The application server communicates with the database to retrieve or update data based on user requests.

7. What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
- The server uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with users computers.
- When a user enters the URL, their browser sends an HTTP request to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8), which is then processed by the web and application servers.

## Issues with this Infrastructure:

- Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Having only one server is risky because all components are hosted on this single server, if this server fails, the whole website goes down.
- Downtime during Maintenance:
When we need to update things, like putting new stuff on the website, we might have to pause it for a bit. This can lead to temporary downtime for visitors.
- Limited Scalability:
If a lot of visitors come to the website at once, the server might struggle . This infrastructure cannot handle high amounts of incoming traffic effectively. It cannot scale horizontally to accommodate increased load.
