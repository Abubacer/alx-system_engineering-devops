# 0x0B. SSH

## Background Context

Along with this project, we have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, we will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, we will not connect using a password but an RSA key. This sever is configured with the public key we created in the first task of a previous project shared in your intranet profile.

We can access our server information in the our servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username we should use to connect via ssh.

Note: The server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- What is a server
- Where servers usually live
- What is SSH
- How to create an SSH RSA key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using ```#!/usr/bin/env bash``` instead of ```/bin/bash```

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All Bash script files must be executable
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/env bash```
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
