# Command line for the win

## Background Context
CMD CHALLENGE is a pretty cool game challenging you on Bash skills. Everything is done via the command line and the questions are becoming increasingly complicated. Itâ€™s a good training to improve your command line skills!

## Requirements

- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- This project will be manually reviewed.
- As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
- Create a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels
- Push this screenshot with the right name to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format

## Specific

In addition to completing the project tasks and submitting the required screenshots to GitHub, I'm also required to demonstrate the use of the SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) command-line tool to move my local screenshots to the sandbox environment.

Here are the steps I followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in this project:

- First I connected to the remote server using sftp command and my sandbox SFTP key and my password.
- I navigated to the working directory/gitHub repo alx-system_engineering-devops.
- I created a new directory command_line_for_the_win on the remote server
- I have Prepared my project file on my local machine.
- I upploaded the screenshots from my local machine to the remote server using put command.
