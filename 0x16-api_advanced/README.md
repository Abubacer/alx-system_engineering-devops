# 0x16. API advanced

## Background Context

Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

A great API to use for some practice is the Reddit API. There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to learn:

- How to read API documentation to find the endpoints you’re looking for
- How to use an API with pagination
- How to parse JSON results from an API
- How to make a recursive API call
- How to sort a dictionary by value

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
- Libraries imported in Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- The code should use the PEP 8 style
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```
- All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
- Must use the Requests module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API
